This implementation uses regular expressions to search for occurrences of an input string in a text stream and to replace sections with an input string.

This Java program processes the search and update commands. It reads from standard input and performs the specified operations. Note that the update operation assumes that the provided range is valid, and it checks for basic range validity. You may need to enhance the range validation based on your specific use case.
